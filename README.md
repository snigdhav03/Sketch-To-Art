## Introduction

This project can transform your casual sketch to beautiful painting/artwork using modern AI technology.

### Screenshots

## Run with Docker

With **[Docker](https://www.docker.com)**, you can quickly build and run the entire application in minutes :whale:

```bash
# 1. First, clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mtobeiyf/sketch-to-art.git
cd sketch-to-art

# 2. Build Docker image
docker build -t sketch-to-art:dev .

# 3. Run!
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 5001:5001 -p 5002:5002 sketch-to-art:dev
```

Then, go to **localhost:8080** and play with the demo! :tada:

## Theories

To achieve the goal, there are mainly two steps in the pipeline:

- Reconstruct and generate *real* image from the sketch
- Arbitary style transfer to beautify the result with given result

### Sketch Reconstruction

The principle behind this is called **Conditional Adversarial Networks**, known as [pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/), which is able to generate image based on the given image.

### Style Transfer

It became known to us with the appearance of [Prisma](https://prisma-ai.com/) app. Typically, we generate an individual model for each pre-defined style. Here, we want to go further by using any new picture as the style. So, we adopted the method, [**Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08086) proposed in NIPS2017, which enables us to perform arbitary style transfer.

## Manual Installation

### Backend

The server side is powered by Python and Flask. You can see this [simpler example](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp).
Navigate to the `server` directory and all the files concerning the service and neural networks are there. The two main files:

- `app_pix.py` for pix2pix translation
- `app_stylize.py` for arbitrary style transfer

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed, and some packages are needed: tensorflow, keras, pillow, flask, gevent.
You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

#### Run

```bash
# Simply run with python
python app_xxx.py
```

And you could see the output indicating the port it's listening (5001 and 5002). Go to `http://localhost:5001` and you should see the returned information.

### Frontend

You should installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:mtobeiyf/sketch-to-art.git
cd sketch-to-art

# Install dependencies
yarn  # or npm install

# Run
yarn dev  # or npm run dev
```

Open your favorite browser at `http://localhost:8080`, the site is there.
